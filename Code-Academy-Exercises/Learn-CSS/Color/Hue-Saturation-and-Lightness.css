/* HSL values are: the first number is a degree between 0 and 360, the second two numbers are a percentage for hue and 
   lightness. Hue is the actual color, Saturation refers to the richness of the color, lightness 
   (0% closer to black, 100% closer to white) is the brightness of a color.  If you use RGB, you can't adjust these 
   independently and HSL is useful for this. */
